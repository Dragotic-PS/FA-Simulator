# FA Simulator
A DFA simulator for quickly generating acceptable strings and plotting the DFA. Helps build intuition for how state machines, deterministic finite automatons in particular, work.

## Installation

```
$ pip install pysimpleautomata tabulate statemachine
```

You also need to install [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org//) and set it on your system-path

## Dependencies

### PySimpleAutomata
Used for graphical representation of the FA simulated. Requires GraphViz.

### Tabulate
Used for CLI table to showcase accepted and rejected strings

### StateMachine
Used for state machine simulations. The wrapper was built around this.
